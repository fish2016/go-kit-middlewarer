# stringservice example #
This example is based on [go-kit's example String Service](https://github.com/go-kit/kit/tree/master/examples/stringsvc1/main.go). In order to utilize this example, the command has been written for you, however the generated layers have no been committed, and no binary exists. To this effect a couple
of steps should be taken to get this working.

### Generate the Layers ###
First, the layers for the example service need to be generated. This can be done by following these steps:

- Open a Shell/Terminal
- Navigate to The String Service Path:
	```cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fish2016/go-kit-middlewarer/examples/stringsvc```
- Run go's generate command:
	```go generate```

### Build the Binary ###
Next the binary itself will need to be built. This binary is already written to import the layers that were generated by assuming that it is still in your `GOPATH`. So building or installing the binary should be easy.

- Open a Shell/Terminal
- Navigate to the StringService command's main.go folder:
	```cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fish2016/go-kit-middlewarer/examples/stringsvc/cmd/stringsvc```
- Build or install the command: ```go build .``` or ```go install```

### Testing the Service ###
Testing the result should be fairly simple, provided you have the ```curl``` command. At this point, all you should have to do is launch the service.
`./stringsvc` if it is in the current working directory, and not in your `PATH` environment variable, or just `stringsvc` if it is.

Once that is running, in another Terminal/Shell instance, you can use curl to make a request against the service:
```bash
curl localhost:9000/stringservice/uppercase -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"str": "this is a test"}'
```

#### Some minor notes ####
If the default port, `9000` doesn't work for you, you can change it in the source.

The `Content-Type` should be supplied for the request in order for it to be decoded effectively.  However, if it is not supplied, the encoding package will attempt to determine the encoding by sniffing it, and then by brute-force if need be.

#### TODOs ####
- allow the bind address to be overwritten via a commandline argument
- default to `localhost:9000`, for the bind address.
